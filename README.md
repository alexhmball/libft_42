# libft - Learning Outcomes and Reflection

The Libft project provided me with an opportunity to deepen my understanding of C programming and the standard library functions. By creating my own library called "libft," I learned essential concepts and honed my coding skills. In this project, I implemented various functions from scratch and learned how to use them effectively in future C assignments.

## Learning Outcomes
Throughout the Libft project, I achieved the following learning outcomes:

1. **Understanding Standard C Library Functions:** I gained a thorough understanding of standard C library functions like strlen, memcpy, strchr, and others. By recreating these functions as part of my libft library, I solidified my comprehension of their inner workings.

2. **Memory Management:** I learned the importance of proper memory allocation and deallocation. I ensured that all dynamically allocated memory was freed when necessary, avoiding memory leaks and improving the efficiency of my code.

3. **Makefile Usage:** I created a Makefile to automate the compilation process of my library and projects. I followed specific rules, such as all, clean, fclean, and re, to facilitate code management.

4. **Norm Compliance:** Adhering to the Norm standards helped me write clean and readable code. I focused on proper indentation, function length, and variable naming conventions, making my code more maintainable.

5. **Implementing Custom Library Functions:** By implementing my own versions of standard C functions with the "ft_" prefix, I gained hands-on experience with function development and testing.

6. **Working with Linked Lists (Bonus Part):** As part of the bonus section, I worked with linked lists, developing functions to manipulate and iterate over them. This experience deepened my understanding of data structures and enhanced my problem-solving skills.

## Reflection
The Libft project was challenging but immensely rewarding. It provided me with a solid foundation in C programming and equipped me with essential tools to tackle future programming tasks. I improved my coding skills, learned about memory management, and practiced implementing custom functions. Additionally, the bonus part allowed me to explore advanced concepts like linked lists, further enhancing my programming capabilities.

Overall, the Libft project was an invaluable learning experience, and I am confident that the knowledge gained here will serve me well in my future coding endeavors.
